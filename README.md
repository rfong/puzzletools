# puzzletools

some random little puzzle tools I've written while solving puzzles
- multi language scrabble scorer
- general purpose multi-character string tokenizer

## ideas
- [ ] web REPL where you can write simple text transformers that can be chained together with various pre-defined functions
- [ ] rubiks cube viewer/solver with labelable stickers and urlparam state (I wish I had this for remote collaborators on most hunts)
  - [ ] after mh2024 maybe write a variant that allows invalid cubie states too

## existing scripts to port here?
- [ ] wordle finder
- [ ] IPA wordle finder
- [ ] counterfeit monkey helper
